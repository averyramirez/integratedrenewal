                  <br />
                  An ongoing relationship called coaching is created to further
                  the goals of a client. The coach offers a framework and a
                  procedure devoted to successfully completing the client's
                  agenda. Clients hire a coach because they want to improve or
                  alter something about themselves or their situation and
                  believe they will get their desired outcomes through a
                  relationship that is centered on fostering transformation. For
                  a client, a coach improves and optimizes a process, resulting
                  in the significant, meaningful change the client desires.

                  <br />
                  Counseling is not coaching. A professional coach assists
                  clients who are generally in good health and who are
                  resourceful and capable of achieving their goals and improving
                  or optimizing their lives. Professional Counselors, as opposed
                  to Coaches, are qualified and trained to assist clients who
                  are struggling with emotional and mental health concerns.
                  While coaches assist clients in focusing on goals for the
                  future, counselors often assist clients in resolving
                  difficulties from the past.

            Coaching is not about delivering advice; rather, it is founded on
            the idea that the best way to help you change is to build a
            structured, encouraging relationship that encourages you to take
            control of your life and make the changes you want to make.

            <br />Establish rapport, spend some time on accountability (1st
            session will not have this), identify today’s issue, reframe the
            individual challenges to find solutions together, walk the
            individual through relevant strategies, and come up with an action
            plan.
